# Kings Resort Hotel
A part of a school project which was to design and build a functional website for a Resort Hotel.

# My role in this project
I worked on the Rooms Page, Individual Rooms Page and the Rooms Booking Page
Everything on these pages are done by me, including the navigation bar and footer:

# Our Purpose
Let’s have a look at the WHY behind our project. Every hotel needs a good website, it is the face of the hotel! The design of our website is made with consistency adhering to the brand and trademark of the Kings Resort Hotel. Hotel Websites are a good source of information for prospective guests and can directly impacts sales. We understand the importance of User Experience. So we made it a point to view from the perspective of our users and find out the challenges that they face, to enable us to  make the process of finding what they want on the website more quickly and efficiently, leaving our users happy and in turn ore likely to book a room or event with us.

# Our Approach
Our approach to solve these problems were to first decide the contents of our website, what pages are needed in a hotel website? How can we stand out? 
Next was our research phase, what do other hotel websites look like and have? What do users look for when looking for a hotel room? 
Then, we sketched out ideas on paper and made our HTML/CSS prototype. Then, we worked on responsiveness and usability with the help of Javascript. So who are our users?

# Is it Mobile-Responsive?

74% of users are more likely to return to a mobile-friendly website, so what can we do with that information? With that, we made it a point to make our website mobile-responsive, this is how it looks on mobile.

# Why did i choose this design and choose to add a price range function?
What’s the first thing you want to see when looking for the perfect room? You would want to see how the room looks right? Imagine if a hotel website you were looking at barely showed any images of the hotel rooms, would you still be interested? Hence, i decided to make the images of the rooms the key point on the page. On hover, the image zooms in, leading the users eyes to the image of our hotel room. Now, what’s the next thing you would like to see? 
<br><br>
From my user research, i found that users usually have a budget in mind. Hence, to address the needs of the user, i added a the price range filter
We never want to find a beautiful room only to find out that it is way out of your price range. So with this price range rilter,our users can quickly and easily find the available rooms for the price they have in mind.

Other Features of the Main Rooms Page:
- Easily see an overview of each hotel room → click see more button to see more details and the book now button to book and check availability
- Making use of visual hierarchy→ the important things like the name of the hotel is the biggest and in a different font
- Following the gestault principle, proximity → details of the each hotel room is put together to show that they are related, with the use of whitespace around each hotel room and its details, to bring focus to the center of the page where the details are
<br><br>
Features of the Individual Room Page:
- Looking at the page, as a user, we can compare the details/hotel amenities of each hotel room
- Call to action at the side here, and away frm the rest showing its importance
- The gallery also allows for users to see what the hotel room would look like, allowing them to know what to expect and can hence more confidently book a room.

Features of the Rooms Bookings Page:
- According to one of the 10 rules of nielsen's heuristics, user control and freedom →When it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an action, it fosters a sense of freedom and confidence. Exits allow users to remain in control of the system and avoid getting stuck and feeling frustrated. Hence, in our bookings page can control which tab you want to go to, to see the whole form with easy navigation → easy for people to undo an action or back out of a part of the bookings form
- Another rule of nielsen's heuristics states that → prevent errors from happening -> increasing usability, with popup tooltips to hint the user of the error, allowing them to easily correct it with little to no frustration.
- A tick appears for the section they have completed allowing users to easily see which part of the form has not been completed. upon completion of the form an alert would let the users know that they have completed the form successfully. If users have not completed the form, the alert would let users know which part of the form they have to complete.
